1. Question 1
Given an array arr[ ] of size N having elements, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array.
Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the right which is greater than the current element.If there does not exist next greater of current element, then next greater element for current element is -1. For example, next greater of the last element is always -1.

def findNextGreaterElements(arr):
    stack = []
    result = []

    # Iterate through the array from right to left
    for i in range(len(arr)-1, -1, -1):
        # Pop elements from the stack while they are smaller than or equal to arr[i]
        while stack and stack[-1] <= arr[i]:
            stack.pop()

        # If stack is empty, there is no greater element to the right
        if not stack:
            result.append(-1)
        else:
            result.append(stack[-1])

        # Push arr[i] onto the stack
        stack.append(arr[i])

    # Reverse the result array
    result.reverse()

    return result

# Example usage
arr = [1, 3, 2, 4]
result = findNextGreaterElements(arr)
print(result)  # Output: [3, 4, 4, -1]

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the size of the input array.

2. Given an array a of integers of length n, find the nearest smaller number for every element such that the smaller element is on the left side.If no small element is present on the left print -1.
def findNearestSmaller(n, a):
    stack = []
    result = []

    for num in a:
        while stack and stack[-1] >= num:
            stack.pop()

        if not stack:
            result.append(-1)
        else:
            result.append(stack[-1])

        stack.append(num)

    return result

# Example usage:
print(findNearestSmaller(3, [1, 6, 2]))  # Output: [-1, 1, 1]
print(findNearestSmaller(6, [1, 5, 0, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: [-1, 1, -1, 0, 3, 4]
